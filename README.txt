This folder includes the code that was developed to simulate the two
successful leg placement strategies in a 3D spring-mass bipedal model.
Each strategy is in a separate folder, ratio-beta and beta. 
This work was a dissertation project for the MSc Robotics programme (2016-2017) at the University of Bristol and the report titled “Leg placement control based on passive dynamics of a 3D walking model” is included as well for a detailed description of the applied methods.

The functions in both folders (leg strategies) are identical for the most part, with some strategy-specific parts noted with comments. Different strategies can be applied to the model and their stability assessed by changing these blocks of code in biped3_step and biped3_TD functions, which include the step dynamics and the touch-down event respectively. Some additions may be necessary in the systems structure sys if novel control variables are introduced.

The sequence of this code begins with the biped3_lc_search function, which utilises a custom-built Newton-Raphson algorithm to find stable limit cycles of the system. Then, function biped3_lc_param parses through the found limit cycles, identifies any potential duplicate walking patterns that correspond to these limit cycles and calculates useful gait parameters, such as step time, length, width and mean velocities. From that point on, the *_lc.mat file (where * is either ratio_beta or beta, depending on the considered leg strategy) containing all the kinematic and control parameters of each unique limit cycle can be used for further analysis. Some examples are presented in functions biped3_step_ex (simulates walking), biped3_grf_ex (calculates and plots ground reaction forces), biped3_basin_ex (calculates partial basins of attraction for a limit cycle) and biped3_basin_all (calculates partial basins of attraction for all found limit cycles). Finally, biped3_basin_plot is used to plot the resulted basins of attraction, either for a single pattern or for all of them.
